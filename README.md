# planets-data-structures

The series of programs done to manipulate various data structures in the context of various planets, the distances between them and the costs and benefits of reaching them. The data structures employed include quick sort, dijkstra's shortest path, kruskal's algorithm and the 0/1 Knapsack. Data is read in from files generated by a separate program and are loaded as class objects that are manipulated by the program. This report summarizes the core mechanisms behind the algorithms and their outputs.

The programs include:
1) Quick Sort and Graph Output
2) Djikstra's Shortest Path
3) Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
4) 0/1 Knapsack for Optimising Benefit
